## Economic Constriaint
The use of the JUCE Framework requires using a liscensing plan provided by JUCE in relation to an organization's projected revenue for developing a plugin and
how much customization an organization wants.These plans include personal, Indie, Pro, and Education. For the development of the Earthenware plugin 
the team will use the Education plan if this plugin is published. The plan consists of an unlimited revenue that can be generated by the plugin and 
requires the implementation of a splash screen that states “Made with JUCE”. 

## Legal Constraints

Our VST plug-in is using a framework called JUCE. JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework that can be used for the development of desktop and mobile applications. It is dual licensed under the GPLv3 and a commercial license. If you sell the plug-in you make with JUCE, you will need a commercial license.

There are multiple commercial licensing tiers for JUCE, with different terms for each:
- JUCE Personal (developers or startup businesses with revenue under 50K USD) - free
- JUCE Indie (small businesses with revenue under 500K USD) - $40/month or $800 perpetual
- JUCE Pro (no revenue limit) - $130/month or $2600 perpetual
- JUCE Educational (no revenue limit) - free for bona fide educational institutes

Depending on if we look to sell the product after our senior design presentation, we could in fact have legal ramifications.
