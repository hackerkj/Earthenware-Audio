## Economic Constriaint
The use of the JUCE Framework requires using a liscensing plan provided by JUCE in relation to an organization's projected revenue for developing a plugin and
how much customization an organization wants.These plans include personal, Indie, Pro, and Education. For the development of the Earthenware plugin 
the team will use the Education plan if this plugin is published. The plan consists of an unlimited revenue that can be generated by the plugin and 
requires the implementation of a splash screen that states “Made with JUCE”.
