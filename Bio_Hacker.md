# Potential Project
My name is Klayton Hacker and my major is Computer Science. I am not yet completely sure what the requirements of the senior design project are, however I am interested in developing audio processing software. I would like to develop VST Plugins for musical audio software application.  Some of the fields I hope to work in are Digital Signal Processing, GUI development, and the VST framework.  If there are any people out there that are into musical recording software let me know!
