  Key Detector
  
  # Abstract
Since the development of audio recording, recording artists and musicians have searched for tools to make the production process work smoothly. A metronome can keep musicians in time, while a tuner keeps them in tune. The Key Detector was designed in response to a lack of real time or semi-real time solutions in key detection. Instead of working staticallly on an input file, our Key Detector analyzes live audio data, similar to a tuner. The detector returns a ranked listing of keys, and when slelected, marks the notes on a piano. With this given output, users of a varying degree of musical and production knowledge will be able to communicate musically in a responsive manner.
