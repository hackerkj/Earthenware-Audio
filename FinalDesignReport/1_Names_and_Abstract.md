  # Abstract
  Since the development of audio recording, recording artist and musicians alike have been in constant search of tools to make the production process as smooth and efficient as possible.
  A metronome can keep musicians in time, while a tuner keeps them in tune.
  Earthenware sets out to provide the artist with a tool which can aid in the communication process. 
  Our software will identify the key most likely played by a musician, given sufficient input that includes a set of parameters provided by the user.
  With this given output, users of a varying degree of musical and productional knowledge will be able to create music in alignment across all relevant instruments.
