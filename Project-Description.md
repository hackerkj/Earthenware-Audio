## Project Idea
I am interested in developing audio processing software. 
I would like to develop VST Plugins for musical audio software application. 
Some of the fields I hope to work in are Digital Signal Processing, GUI development, and the VST framework. 
The main goal of my audio plugin(s) will be to be musical and inspiring to use for musicians and producers.
Too often, making music on a laptop can feel robotic and dull, I want to help capture the unpredictable and inspiring 
moments that come from making music in a room with people, and inject that into the digital process. 
Nothing will ever replace the creative proccess of being with other humans making music, but often times 
mixers and producers still spend hours on the computer in audio software after everyone else leaves the studio.
Three words to describe my goals when it comes to creating audio plugins are simple, inpiring, and musical. 
Simple because complicated plugins can just be downright frustrating to use. Inspiring because the mixing and 
producing proccess can be long and hard, musical tools are not worth using if they dont inspire. Musical because 
even if the first two goals are met, the plugin will never make the final print of the track if the plugin does not 
fit the general guidelines of music theory, for example, rythm and harmony.
